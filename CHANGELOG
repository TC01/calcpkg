calcpkg - Changelog

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0 (not yet released to ticalc.org):

-Now supports multiple 'repositories' (preliminary support for Cemetech exists)
-Package has been renamed to "calcrepo", script is still called calcpkg
-Argument switches and command line help have all been overhauled
-Most of the code has been rewritten and further modularized
-And more!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 (sixth version released to ticalc.org, uploaded 9/2/11):

-Changed list output with -f switch to display archive file name (title is still displayed without -f switch)
-Fixed bug where combining -f and -c [category] switches did not work
-Fixed bug with logging not working due to 1.0 update, disabled entirely on Windows but log by default on Linux (to /tmp/calpkg.log).
-Combined -n and -p options into a global -y (--assume-yes) option
-Clean command now merely deletes the .index files (the 1.0 update broke it)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0 (fifth version released to ticalc.org, uploaded 8/26/11):

-Added an "info" command that uses HTML parsing to get file info
-Added support to automatically extract .tar.gz (.tgz) and .tar.bz2 archives
-Changed calcpkg.py line encoding to Unix, so it's executable on Unix systems
-Changed output formatting for "list" command to take up less space
-Restructured program- now contains Python ticalcDotOrg package and calcpkg script
-Program now installs as a normal Python package
-Program now downloads to your Downloads folder (ex: /home/username/Downloads, C:\Users\username\Downloads)
-Renamed script from "calcpkg.py" to "calcpkg" (so you don't have to type .py all the time, it's still a Python file).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8 (fourth version released to ticalc.org, uploaded 2/5/10):

-Added a fake "install" command that does the same thing as "get"
-Added an option to search by file extensions (like .zip or .tar.gz)

	"83plus-asm-games-generate-zip"
-Added an option to only print the version and then exit
-Clean command will now remove files created by the extraction option

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.7 (third version released to ticalc.org, uploaded 12/19/10):

-Added an option to search the file index rather than the name index (-f)
-Added logging functionality (-l) that logs output to a textfile, calcpkg.log
-Added clean command, which removes all .zip, .tar.gz, and .log files from the current folder
-Added mechanism for easily redirecting output (allowing another program to make all the print statements go somewhere else)
-Added a fake "search" command that does the same thing as "list"
-Added options for disabling the prompts before downloading and updating (-n and -p respectively)
-Included a sample script that shows how calcpkg can be imported in a module and used as part of another program
-Fixed bug where -g and -m searching options ran together would not work
-The searching options now work with the count and get commands as well

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Uploaded a separate Unix/Linux version with Unix/Linux file endings
